# steel5

A RISC-V emulator written in Rust, because I wanted to do something in Rust :smile:

steel5 will implement the 32-bit RISC-V instruction set (RV32I), and the 64-bit one after
that. 

For now, it does not run any instruction.

## Objectives

The final objective is to run Linux and NetBSD. I think both have risc-v support.
